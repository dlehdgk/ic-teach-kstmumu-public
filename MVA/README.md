Multi Variate Analysis
======================

A multivariate analysis (MVA) is a catch-all term for data analysis that combines features of several variables. Examples of MVAs include Fisher Discriminants, Decision Trees, Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs), Neural Networks (NN). The precise choice of MVA is up to the analyst, depending on what they are trying to achieve.

Many HEP analyses use an MVA for the purpose of classification - usually to divide the data into background and signal for improved precision. An MVA is often more powerful than a simple cut-based selection as it can exploit non-linear relations between many variables.

Here we provide a simple example of an MVA based on only two variables.
